# Wine Quality Ensemble Machine Learning Project Plan

## Section 1. Load and Inspect the Data

### 1.1 Load the dataset
- Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and required sklearn modules
- Load the "winequality-red.csv" file using pandas with explicit separator parameter since the file uses semicolons


### 1.2 Explore dataset properties
- Get information about the dataset structure
- View the first few rows 
- Get statistical summary of numerical features
- Check for missing values
- Check the shape of the dataset (number of samples and features)

### 1.3 Understand the dataset features
- Note that we have 11 physicochemical input variables:
  - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine (tartaric acid)
  - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid (vinegar taste)
  - citric acid: adds freshness and flavor
  - residual sugar: amount of sugar after fermentation
  - chlorides: amount of salt
  - free sulfur dioxide: prevents microbial growth
  - total sulfur dioxide: sum of free and bound forms
  - density: related to alcohol and sugar content
  - pH: describes acidity
  - sulphates: additive that contributes to SO2 levels
  - alcohol: percentage of alcohol
- The target variable is quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Section 2. Prepare the Data

### 2.1 Data visualization and EDA
- Create histograms for each feature to understand distributions
- Create box plots to identify outliers in each feature
- Create correlation matrix and heatmap to identify relationships between features
- Specifically examine correlation of each feature with quality
- Look for patterns or clusters in the data

### 2.2 Feature engineering
- Create quality categories (low, medium, high) where:
  - Low: quality ≤ 4
  - Medium: quality 5-6
  - High: quality ≥ 7
- Create numeric quality categories (0, 1, 2) corresponding to the categories above
- Consider feature transformations if distributions are skewed

### 2.3 Data cleaning
- Handle any outliers if necessary
- Check for skewed distributions that might benefit from transformation
- Consider standardizing/normalizing features if needed
- Confirm no missing values in the dataset

## Section 3. Feature Selection and Justification

### 3.1 Analyze feature importance
- Calculate correlation of each feature with quality
- Create scatter plots of key features vs. quality
- Identify the top features with highest correlation to quality


### 3.2 Define input features and target
- Based on EDA, select the most promising features 
- Set up X (features) and y (target) variables
- Justify the selected features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge
- Identify the top 3 features with highest correlation to quality for model comparison

## Section 4. Split the Data into Train and Test

### 4.1 Create train-test split
- Use sklearn's train_test_split with test_size=0.2
- Use random_state=42 for reproducibility
- Use stratify parameter to preserve class distribution

### 4.2 Verify split characteristics
- Check sizes of training and test sets
- Verify that class distribution is maintained in both sets
- Confirm that features are properly split

## Section 5. Evaluate Model Performance

### 5.1 Create evaluation function
- Define a helper function that:
  - Takes a model name, model instance, training data, test data, and results list
  - Fits the model to training data
  - Makes predictions on both train and test sets
  - Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores
  - Prints confusion matrix and performance metrics
  - Appends results to the results list

### 5.2 Define model options
- Create a selection mechanism for choosing models to evaluate
- Define configurations for all 9 model options:
  1. Random Forest (100 trees)
  2. Random Forest (200 trees, max_depth=10)
  3. AdaBoost (100 estimators)
  4. AdaBoost (200 estimators, learning_rate=0.5)
  5. Gradient Boosting (100 estimators)
  6. Voting Classifier (DT + SVM + NN)
  7. Voting Classifier (RF + LR + KNN)
  8. Bagging (DT, 100 estimators)
  9. MLP Classifier

### 5.3 Run selected models
- Implement logic to only run selected models based on user choice
- Choose at least two models to evaluate, as specified in the requirements
- Store results for comparison

## Section 6. Compare Results

### 6.1 Create results table
- Convert results list to DataFrame
- Add derived metrics such as accuracy gap and F1 gap
- Sort by test accuracy to find best models

### 6.2 Visualize comparison
- Create bar charts comparing model performance
- Visualize the gap between training and testing metrics to identify overfitting

### 6.3 Statistical analysis
- Calculate mean and standard deviation of performance across models
- Identify best performing model based on test metrics
- Identify model with best generalization (smallest train-test gap)

## Section 7. Conclusions and Insights

### 7.1 Model performance analysis
- Identify the best performing model and its characteristics
- Compare ensemble methods to simpler models (if included)
- Analyze if models are overfitting (large train-test gap) or underfitting

### 7.2 Feature importance analysis
- For tree-based methods, extract and analyze feature importances
- Create a bar chart of feature importances
- Identify the most influential features for wine quality prediction

### 7.3 Recommendations and next steps
- Suggest model improvements (hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering)
- Discuss the practical implications for wine quality prediction
- Propose next steps for further analysis or model refinement
